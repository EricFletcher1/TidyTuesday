My contributions to the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project, a weekly data project created by [Thomas Mock](https://github.com/jthomasmock) aimed at the R ecosystem with an emphasis on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `{ggplot2}`, `{tidyr},` `{dplyr}`, and other tools in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem.It is a terrific resource for individuals, like myself, who are new to programming.
